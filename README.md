## live location share

A demo of a web app with which user can share real-time location with another user. The app utilizes MapboxGL, Firebase realtime database and ReactJS (+ redux). 

Typical use cases are 1) sharing location (user clicks the "Share Location" button and a location share is then generated including a link that directs to the location share) and 2) tracking location (user opens a link that directs to a shared location). Both location sharing and tracking are presented visually on a map and distance between user location and tracked location is calculated (with Turf.js).
